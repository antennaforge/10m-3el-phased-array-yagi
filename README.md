# 10m-yagi-phased-array

This HF antenna is based on the compact [3-element yagi design](https://antenna2.github.io/cebik/content/a10/ant53.html) by [LB Cebik, W4RNL (SK)](https://www.qcwa.org/w4rnl-13211-sk.htm) with slight modifications (antenna element materials). Many more of his works can be found [here](https://antenna2.github.io/cebik/content/bookant.html).

Have fun building this one.
